Observation: Since 2000, robots and automation systems have slowly phased out many manufacturing jobs — 1.7 million of them. On the flip side, it's predicted that AI will create 97 million new jobs by 2025. Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Replace Jobs? AI is and will continue to replace some jobs. The Effects of Automation on Jobs . Automation has taken the manufacturing industry by storm. Even in the years prior to the pandemic, many people worried about the effect of automation on the jobs of tomorrow. With a sharp increase in the use of robotics in the manufacturing industry, there is valid concern about how the future workforce will ... AI in Manufacturing Artificial intelligence is currently used in manufacturing plants all over the world to reduce critical errors, drastically improve production times and boost safety measures in what is known as the "Industry 4.0" era. A recent report from Goldman Sachs estimates around 300 million jobs could be affected by generative AI, meaning 18% of work globally could be automated—with more advanced economies heavily... While the net impact of most technologies on jobs is expected to be positive over the next five years, employers predict a structural labour market churn of 23% of jobs - a combination of 10.2% job growth and 12.3% decline.

Observation: The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 finds most technologies will have a positive impact on jobs in the coming five years. But almost a quarter of jobs will change as various impacts, including the green transition, play out. As automation and artificial intelligence continue to advance, there is growing concern about how these technologies will impact the job market. While some experts argue that automation... Adding new jobs and careers. One of the primary worries about AI is that it will take workers' jobs at a staggering rate. Some data confirms that, indeed, this technology will affect a swath of ... Most panellists think that AI is likely to boost global growth to 4-6% per annum (relative to an average of 4% over the past few decades). Most of the panel also believes that AI is unlikely to affect employment rates in high-income countries, with the remainder split between predicting an increase and a decrease in unemployment rates. While the study expects AI to result in "significant labor-market disruption," the net impact of most technologies will be positive over the next five years as big data analytics,...

Observation: Some workforce experts say AI and other new technologies will hurt middle-level, white-collar jobs more than lower-paying, physically intensive jobs. McKinsey's Madgavkar said it will be hard... AI's effect on employment will be similar to the effect of spreadsheets on the finance industry. AI can get a bad rap. The idea that artificial intelligence can automate work naturally raises the ... Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) provide a historical example of excessive automation negatively affecting the labour market due to weak productivity and reinstatement effects, finding that areas in the US most exposed to industrial automation in the 1990s and 2000s experienced large and robust negative effects on employment and wages.
